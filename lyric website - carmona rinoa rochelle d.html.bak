				<p> This city's chaotic at night <br>
					Da, da da-bi-da-doo <br>
					Get all the things I want <br>
					I wanna do, wanna do, wanna do <br>
					<br>
					Don't hide what you wanna do <br>
					Come on, da, da, da-bi-da-doo <br>
					Get all the things I want <br>
					I wanna do, wanna do, wanna do <br>
					<br>
					You are tempted by my smell <br>
					Like a bee that seeks honey <br>
					どうしようもなくボクの側に居たい <br>
					You don't have to say anything <br>
					Because I can feel your all <br>
					Throughout the night <br>
					Party time <br>
					<br>
					Yeah<br>
					Party time <br>
					Yeah <br>
					Hope in the dark<br>
					Yeah<br>
					Party time <br>
					Yeah <br>
					<br>
					Are you gonna go?
					Canvas is still blank <br>
					But do it right<br>
					You're gonna gain or pain <br>
					Ideal and ambition <br>
					White darkness <br>
					Hope in the dark<br>
					<br>
					When you have a chance <br>
					You will see what I mean<br>
					Stay real <br>
					Dance in the dark<br>
					Make it a showtime<br>
					It gives you luck<br>
					Spend your life<br>
					Don't believe the hype<br>
					<br>
					Gonna start the game of love<br>
					I wanna shake your body and soul<br>
					どうしようもなくキミの傍にいたい<br>
					Lonely lady, shall we dance?<br>
					I wanna make your heart smile<br>
					Throughout the night <br>
					Party time <br>
					<br>
					Yeah<br>
					Party time <br>
					Yeah <br>
					Hope in the dark<br>
					Yeah<br>
					Party time <br>
					Yeah <br>
					<br>
					Don't hide what you wanna do <br>
					Come on, da, da, da-bi-da-doo <br>
					どうしようもなくキミは僕に染まる<br>
					You don't have to say anything <br>
					Because I can feel your all <br>
					Throughout the night <br>
					Party time</p>
